<h2 id="-domestic-violence-red-flags">🚩 Domestic Violence Red Flags</h2>
<p>If you want the best chance at a healthy relationship with someone, you first need to learn how to avoid obviously unhealthy relationships.</p>
<p>Unfortunately we live in a world where domestic abuse is widespread.</p>
<p>Thankfully, it’s possible to see that you are entering an abusive, toxic relationship <em>before you get trapped in it</em>. There are early warning signs. Abusers use the same patterns—in the same order—in each new relationship. If you know how to spot them, it will be easier to say no.</p>
<h3 id="early-warning-signs">Early warning signs</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Too much</strong>: You are overwhelmed because they are giving you too many gifts, too many complements, too soon in the relationship. Too many texts, DMs late at night. Too much contact. Too many promises and talk about the future. They go from not in your life, to all over your life practically overnight.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Too soon</strong>: They are calling you their future spouse or partner right away. They are making big plans for the two of you, even though you barely know each other. They’re using controlling language, saying things like “You’re mine now.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Transforming</strong>: They immediately start trying to change you. You are an object for their pleasure. They have lots of opinions about you and has unsolicited advice or comments on your tastes, beliefs, career, relationships, and personal style. Rules for how you should behave, how you should use your time, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Constant contact</strong>: They contact you constantly. They expect you to respond right away. They want to go everywhere with you all the time. They want you focused on them, prioritizing their needs over your own and everyone else’s.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Isolating</strong>: Abuse thrives in isolation. So, they want to isolate you. They will criticize your loved ones or your friends, eventually getting you to cut off contact and shut down your external support structures so they can have you all to themselves.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="heading"></h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to know what the red flags are. The lines that should never be crossed.  Does your partner ever&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>Insult, demean or embarrass you with put-downs?</li>
<li>Control what you do, who you talk to or where you go?</li>
<li>Look at you or act in ways that scare you?</li>
<li>Push you, slap you, choke you or hit you?</li>
<li>Stop you from seeing your friends or family members?</li>
<li>Control the money in the relationship? Take your money or Social Security check, make you ask for money or refuse to give you money?</li>
</ul>

<p>Even if you can see all the clear warning signs of an abuser, it can be hard to say no!Maybe you don’t want to hurt their feelings, or you’re afraid they’ll get angry. If you&rsquo;re in the US, reach out to the <a href="http://thehotline.org/">National Domestic Violence Hotline</a> for support.  If you are afraid your internet usage might be monitored, call them at 800.799.7233 or TTY 800.787.3224.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-leave-a-toxic-relationship">How to leave a toxic relationship</h3>
<p>Sometimes you have to leave a relationship because it is toxic.<br>
It’s not worth giving up your sense of safety so that your partner can be abusive.<br>
Abusers are often seen as villains rather than victims.<br>
But everyone suffers in a toxic relationship. Abusers suffer when they reinforce giving in to the darkness and violence rather than building patterns of healthy intimacy. People who have grown up with a lot of violence and adversity often have to learn how to love as adults.<br>
Abusers who are motivated to change can very often recover, and learn healthy intimacy, when they have the right support.<br>
Staying with them in an abusive relationship supports the wrong impulses and intentions, so it is the best thing for you and for them to let go and create a lot of distance.</p>
