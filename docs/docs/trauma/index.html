<h2 id="why-this-is-important">Why this is important</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúYou can be fully in charge of your life only if you can acknowledge the reality of your body, in all its visceral dimensions.‚Äù<br>
‚Äî Bessel van der Kolk, ‚ÄúThe Body Keeps the Score‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No matter how loving and well-intentioned our childhood home was (or is), we all emerge from childhood damaged by our parents, by our schooling, and by society in one way or another. Which means there's an opportunity for even the most &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; of us to heal in ways that we didn't even know we were broken.</p>
<p>Everyone has emotional trauma in their past. It may feel like a negative memory that you keep returning to. Sometimes it's simply the sense that you cannot seem to get out of your head, that your mind is on overdrive all the time and you can't focus, or that you often feel unsafe or triggered. If a negative memory is something that you think should be &ldquo;no big deal,&rdquo; that you believe shouldn't be a problem, and that you wish you could just get over, but it keeps coming up, that is trauma.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;We see gay men who have never been sexually or physically assaulted with similar post-traumatic stress symptoms to people who have been in combat situations or who have been raped.&rdquo;<br>
‚Äî Alex Keuroghlian, a psychiatrist at the Fenway Institute's Center for Population Research in LGBT Health.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Trauma, PTSD and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/childabuseandneglect/acestudy/index.html">adverse childhood experiences (ACEs)</a> are more common among queer people. Internalized queerphobias are also common and often unconscious. In recent years, we have come a long way in understanding how to help people heal more effectively. It's possible to heal triggers and trauma.</p>
<p>One of the pernicious things about childhood trauma is that it can be with you for so long that you come to believe it‚Äôs just part of who you are, something you have to deal with and carry around every day. Healing is possible, and healing can be life changing! I don't mean life changing in the way that is often attributed to chocolate ice cream or <em>One Hundred Years of Solitude</em>. I mean life changing. Truly improving forever how you relate to your own mind and body.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-heal">How to Heal</h2>
<p>Everyone's path through healing trauma is different, even if the outcome is the same. Here are some directions and avenues where this deeper healing can take place. Some people have a history of trauma with a lowercase t. Some have Trauma with a capital T. Some have both going on. It's possible to heal from all kinds of trauma. A few lowercase-t traumas spread out throughout childhood can be more debilitating than one capital-T trauma.</p>

<p>Therapy means so many things. There are many kinds of therapists. So, it's worth learning about various modalities (there are many) and talking to several therapists so that your work will be effective. With the wrong kind of therapy, it's easy to waste a lot of money. But the right kind of therapy is absolutely life changing and is worth every penny.</p>
<h4 id="eye-movement-desensitization-and-reprocessing-emdr-therapy">Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) Therapy</h4>
<p>EMDR is used for PTSD, depression, anxiety, addiction, and phobias. It is different from talk therapy. It uses eye movement (or sounds or vibrations). When you recall a traumatic memory while doing these calming eye movements, the memory gradually loses its charge.</p>
<p>No one knows quite why it works, but the eye movement is similar to what happens during deep sleep. The theory is that trauma is stored in the part of the brain that isn't accessible via talking, so while talk therapy may feel good at the time, it doesn't always have a lasting impact. EMDR makes it possible to truly heal old trauma, sometimes in just a few sessions.</p>

<h4 id="psychedelics">Psychedelics</h4>
<p>There‚Äôs a growing belief that psychedelics, when used in therapy or with a guide, are among the fastest and most effective treatments for complex PTSD. But they come with risks. This is an area of ongoing exploration and recent experimentation, with the FDA currently in stage 3 trials of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy. If all goes as expected, psychedelics will become legal for PTSD therapy in several countries by 2021.</p>

<h4 id="neurofeedback">Neurofeedback</h4>
<p>Neurofeedback uses EEG monitoring to improve brain functioning as you learn to alter your brain activity. By using computer imaging, you receive direct feedback through a ‚Äúbrain map‚Äù that indicates areas of your brain with excessive activity associated with PTSD, such as your fear center. Here you learn how to relax your body and mind to activate the outermost layer of your brain; that which is associated with thinking and decision-making. Typically, 20 sessions will give you enough feedback to understand how to facilitate regulation of your body and mind on your own.</p>
<p>Note: Current research does not support conclusive resultes about the efficacy of neurofeedback.</p>

<h4 id="drawing">Drawing</h4>
<p>In the act of drawing, the patient makes an initial reorganisation of the form of the trauma, and begins to differentiate the adaptive ego, which has the tools and the ability to restructure the experiences, and the traumatic emotional part that suffers those experiences in a condition of impotence and passivity. The person may rapidly access pre-verbal and motor-sensory language, activating inborn creative skills. The use of this tool enables us to access the traumatic material gently, limiting dissociative reactions, bypassing avoidance and flight behaviour and setting a distance from pain by objectivizing. A protective space is created between the self and the part that holds the suffering. A voice to the inner child. The patient is offered the possibility of drawing what is occurring in the self's here and now, and given a choice of different graphic materials. At the end of the drawing and assessment phase the person is asked to note what has emerged, and a brief space of time may be allowed for description without interpretation.</p>

<h4 id="follow-a-dead-teacher">Follow a Dead Teacher</h4>
<p>Many queer people have suffered from religious shame and oppression growing up. So as adults, it makes sense that they may become untrusting of all religious and spiritual guides, philosophers and teachers of all kinds.</p>
<p>This is unfortunate, because having your own spiritual life is incredibly valuable and healing. One way to proceed and reclaim your own sense of consciousness or spirituality is to follow a dead teacher. A dead teacher has no possible incentive or means to harm you or take anything away from you, so you may find it easier to listen to them.</p>
<p>The best dead teachers, in my opinion, are recently dead teachers who lived during contemporary times. Because you do not need anyone else who is currently alive to help you interpret the words of a recently dead teacher. You can have your own relationship with them, and listen to them directly, and decide for yourself how you want to apply their teachings in your life.</p>
